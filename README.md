# HegaonTiles 


Procedural continuous map generation by matching hexagon tiles with a pattern. 
There are 102 different types of hexagonal tiles with a unique pattern. 
Tiles are matched based on their corner colours.  
Every corner of a hexagonal tile got two neighbour corners of hexagon tiles.
Every hexagon tile got 6 neighbour hexagon tiles. 

TODO:  

- Implement Wave Function Collapse 
- Prevent circle elements 
- Use map for a game and check consistency of the pattern 
- Implement some kind of pathfinding mechanism  

DONE:
- Refactor code (corner lookup functions) 
- ScrollY fix
